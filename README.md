Implementing Simplify Basic

Currently there is not much to talk about, this is a well known language, but I am trying
to simplify it, just to be able to write LLVM assembly codes conveniently.

The parser's rule contains many conflicts, and I haven't fix it so far, but the code is
already running, and can compile DIM, SUB, and FUNCTION declarations.
